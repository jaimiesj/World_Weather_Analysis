# API Plans A Vacation
WeatherPy with Python APIs

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to use Open Weather and Google Cloud APIs to gather weather data and subsequent hotel and travel data to ultimately design a platform that would allow a user to plan out a trip based on certain temperature criteria

## Results 
All codes were successfully excuted and weather data was compiled from over 400 cities based on certain temperature requirements. 4 cities found on the east coast of Australia were focused on and a travel itinerary was designed that feature driving directions and location specific information, as seen in the images below
